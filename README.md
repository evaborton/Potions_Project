Questions: I need the screen to pause for a second, then move on. I tried to use time.pause(1), but buffering caused the whole function to happen one second later. I tried to turn buffering off, but solutions I found on google just didn't work.


# Project for Summer of Code: Potions Class

Potions Class is a game to help users memorize 25 common polyatomic ions. Players must select the bottle labeled with the correct ion and drag it to the cauldron in the center.

Note: Only the main code is available here, not the images it uses, because there are around 300 images used and github only allows 100 files in a repository.
